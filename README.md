# Udacity Nanodegree - Cloud Devops Engineer

This repository consists of projects which were conceptualized, implemented and submitted for the nanodegree "Cloud Devops Engineer" by the online academy Udacity.

## Project 1 - AWS Static Website

In this project a static website was hosted on Amazon Web Services using an Amazon S3 bucket. For better availability and improved latency, Amazon CloudFront was then added as a service to provide lower latency when requesting the website by hosting the website content additionally in Amazon's 'edge data centers' close to the actual user.
